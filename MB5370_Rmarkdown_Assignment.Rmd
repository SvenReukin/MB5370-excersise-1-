## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
# installing and running packages 
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
#install.packages("reader")
library(reader)
figure_dataset <- read.csv("figure_dataset.csv")
View (figure_dataset)
```
```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```
# paper of original figure 
#https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X1200036X#bib18 
#The paper used a figure comparing catch rates of blue fin tuna with percent over 
#catch. The figure used two y axis which can make the data missleading and 
#it made the figure hard to read. 
#We re plotted the figure and instead separated the two graphs so they can be
#compared seperatly. 

# Graphing the data 
```{r}
ggplot(data = figure_dataset) + 
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = reported_catch)) +
  labs(title = "Reported catch of blue fin tuna", x = "Year", y = "Tonnes")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = figure_dataset) + 
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = percent_overcatch)) +
  labs(title = "Percent estimate of overcatch", x = "Year", y = "Percent overcatch")
```
